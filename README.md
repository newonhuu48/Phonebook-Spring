Phonebook is my Spring project with one entity - Contact

I featured:

CRUD
Pagination
Security - Login and Register
Roles
JUnit - Unit and Integration tests
Docker Support

Users:
1.
username: root
password: root
role: ADMIN

2.
username: user
password: user
role: USER

3.
username:user2
password:user2
role: USER


I wasn't able to install Docker on my machine, so I hope it works for you or at least that you make it work. :)
